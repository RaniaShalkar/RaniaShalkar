# Hi, I'm [ТВОЁ ИМЯ] 👋

## About Me
Aspiring mobile developer focused on **Flutter** and **Dart**.  
Always curious about **computer engineering** and how things really work under the hood.  
I like building apps that don’t just “run,” but actually feel good to use.  

Outside of coding:  
🎹 I play piano (yes, real keys, not just a keyboard).  
🎨 I draw (sometimes lines of art, sometimes lines of code).  

## Skills
